  <h2>Faun</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fauntube/featured" target="_blank" title="fauntube">Faun</a> is a German band</strong> formed in 1998 who play pagan folk, darkwave and medieval music.
  The originality of their music style is that they fall back to "old" instruments, and the singing is always the center of attention. The vocals are performed in a variety of languages, including German, Latin, Greek, and Scandinavian languages. Their instruments include Celtic harp, Swedish nyckelharpa, hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes, cittern, flutes and many others.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:35px;">The band was founded in 1998 by Oliver "s. Tyr" Pade, Elisabeth Pawelke, Fiona Rüggeberg and Birgit Muggenthaler. Two years later, Rüdiger Maul got into the band as percussionist. At the same time, Birgit left the band, to continue her musical life with the folk-rock band Schandmaul. In 2002, they released their first album Zaubersprüche. Niel Mitra was a guest musician on this album, and he later became a full-time member of the band, the only one playing only electronic instruments.</p>
